# self-driving-car-neural-network
Self-driving car simulator built with NumPy and PyGame. Each car is controlled by a small neural network that takes in five distance sensors plus its current speed and steering and acceleration commands. The cars improve through a natural-selection-style evolutionary algorithm that evolves their weights and biases over generations of 60 cars
